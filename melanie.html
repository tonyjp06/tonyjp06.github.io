			  <h1 class="melanie"> Melanie Martinez</h1>
			  <h2> Margret Court Arena - Mon 5 Feb 2024 </h2>
	
    <p> The Melanie Martinez concert at Margaret Court Arena on February 5th, was a very nostalgic experience for me. Her captivating blend of music and art, left a lasting impression on me the whole concert. The wait for the concert was my longest one yet. Eventually after getting through, the walk to the barricade was crazy. I was in drag wearing 6 inch Heals and tripped about 7 times. Once we were at out spot, we didn't move.   </p>
			  	<p> What sets this concert apart was Melanie's innovative approach to storytelling. Through a combination of music, visuals, and choreography. She created a sensory overloaded experience, that transported us to a world of wonder.</p>
		 <p> One of the highlights of the evening was Melanie's interaction with the audience. She uses her worldwide platform to speak and shed light on societal issues. For example, she actually spoke up about the issues in Gaza, racism and phobias. </p>
			  	<p> I have loved Melanie ever since I was 12 and attending this concert was such a magical experience. As the concert drew to a close, Butterfly confetti fell from the ceiling and I started crying. This was the concert I had waited for the longest time; my childhood was complete. The Melanie concert was everything I ever dreamed of I could never express how much I loved it.</p>
