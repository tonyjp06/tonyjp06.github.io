			  <h1>BIlLIE EILISH</h1>
			  <h2> Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne - Mon 26 Sep, 2022, Sat 24 Sep, 2022 </h2>
	
    <p> I have had the privilege of going to many concerts. Yet, there is one that beats them all. Billie Eilish. Her show in the Rod Laver Arena was enchanting. She lit up the stage with her presence, as all eyes were on her. Billie's Voice was mesmerising and echoed through the streets of Melbourne. It was the best thing I have ever experienced. She is coming back in 2025 for her, 'Hit Me Hard and Soft Tour', and you already know I will be at the barricade.   </p>
			  	<p> Being in the pit for Billie was tremendous. Having the opportunity to see her up close like that was something I would not trade for the world. My best friend, Amelia actually touched her hand, while she was running off the stage. Amelia is the biggest fan of Billie I know, and I’m so glad she got to have that moment. Outside of the pit, we actually met Billie's mum, Maggie. She was the sweetest person. So loving and caring. She gave us a hug and we had the longest chat. Talking about her family, career and pets. In fact, Maggie attends all of Billies Concerts to show her support and I saw her both nights.</p>
