    <p> Concerts are amazing. They are such a surreal experience that everyone needs to see. Even at least once. There is something about just being in a stadium full of people who all came to see the same person that is so brilliant. I have been to Eight concerts so far, and will be bringing you through my experience with four of them. You might be asking, why do you love concerts so much? Well, let me tell you!  </p>
			  	<p> 
		<ol>
			<li> I love music. It's a kind of therapy for me, depending on the song, it takes me out of reality a little bit.</li>
				<li>Helps with my Mental Illnesses. Music and be a extremely good distracter whenever I’m feeling distressed or overwhelmed.</li>
				<li>It gives me Motivation. When I'm feeling lazy Music helps me get myself into gear and back to doing the things I need to do.</li>

	      &nbsp;I could keep the list going but it would go for way too long, but to summarise, I love music.
        </ol>
